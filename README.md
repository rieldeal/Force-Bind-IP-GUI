# Force-Bind-IP-GUI
A simple GUI to launch applications using the existing program ForceBindIP (not included) 
***Tested only on my own machine, does not work with all programs. This program comes with no warranty, use at your own risk.***

Requires:

ForceBindIP (https://r1ch.net/projects/forcebindip)
Python 3.6.2 (non compiled version only)
appJar http://appjar.info/ (non compiled version only)

This is a simple GUI to launch files using the ForceBindIP64.exe file written by Richard Stanway.

You will be prompted for the location of your ForceBindIP64.exe, as well as the IP address you wish to bind your launched programs to. It will then create a file called 'config.ini' in the same directory that the file is placed in. 

Once you select a program to launch, you will be prompted if you would like to add it to the config file. If you select yes, it will add a new button to the GUI and reload itself.
